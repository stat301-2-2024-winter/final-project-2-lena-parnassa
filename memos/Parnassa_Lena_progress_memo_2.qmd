## Assesment Metric


## Analysis Plan


## Model Types


## Fit Demonstration


## Misc
I didn't clarify this in my first progress memo but I'm doing a regression problem.

I do see my computer's capabilities as being an actual limiting factor in this project. I've had it for seven years and it's nearing the end of its life. One of the main issues is that my battery has trouble holding a charge and it recently managed to die in under three hours while my computer was plugged in. It's not consistently that bad but it is occasionally that bad. I wanted to mention this in advance because I know we're supposed to have models that run overnight but I genuinely do not know if my will be able to do that.
