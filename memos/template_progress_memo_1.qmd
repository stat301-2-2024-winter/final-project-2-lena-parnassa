```

## Data source

This data is from the lab I'm working in^[https://echinaceaproject.org/]. The specific datasets I'm planning on working with are our [core dataset](https://echinaceaproject.org/datasets/expt1-core/), which includes a few basic metrics recorded annually for each plant in our largest experimental plot, and a datset on [insect damage](https://echinaceaproject.org/datasets/km-aphid-abundance-and-plant-damage-2004-2012/) to the plants in the garden in specific observation years.

## Why this data

I'm an Environmental Science major and the whole reason I wanted to do the Data Science minor was to have a better understanding of the data involved in the field. This project would be a great opportunity for me to apply the understanding Iâ€™ve gained so far, and see where the gaps in my knowledge are so I know what I need to improve on.

## Data quality & complexity check
```{r , echo=FALSE}
miss_table <- miss_var_summary(joined_data) |>
  filter(n_miss != 0)
miss_names <- miss_table |>
  pull(variable)

miss_summary <- joined_data |>
  select(all_of(miss_names)) |>
  miss_var_summary() |>
  knitr::kable()

miss_summary
```
