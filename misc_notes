This is a document of my emotional journey working on this final, if you're in the process of grading my work this won't be useful to you, however if you think watching my slow (rapid) decent into madness would be rly cool and funny feel free to continue.

Stuart said that `pos` should be a centered and made into a quadratic bc the garden is on a hill and i should figure out what he means by that
  -can use step_ns or step_poly()

Site of orgin pedigree seems like it would be an increadibly useful variable however its recorded in such a way that its basically unusable
    -harass stuart about this at some point
        -stuart is apparently out bc hes doing a podcast so thats a dead end ig

figure out how to transform ach_ct, log doesnt work bc there are too many zero
    - im doing a square root and leaving it at that
    - deleating most of the zeros also helped


why does my elastic net model keep failing!?!?!?! this doesnt seem like the model that should be failing
    -idk what i did but i fixed it :)

should measure_year be num, factor, or date???

changes to make in feature engineered recipe: step interact between pos + row, year planted as factor

UPDATE READMES

wyatt has started singing its me hi im the problem its me whenever i vocalize that i fucked something up

running my rf model on my laptop makes it overheat for longer than my hot rice pack will stay warm
  - im also convinced my rf model would run faster on my hot rice pack than it would on my pos laptop
